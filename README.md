# `pocket-id` on GCP

This is a terraform configuration to fully automatically provision and run `pocket-id`
on GCP and Cloudflare as well as periodically backup to Backblaze. It also
serves a webfinger document that some OIDC RPs require.

It uses:

- Cloud Run for running `pocket-id` and the backup to avoid a VM
- Cloud Storage mounts so we can use sqlite and avoid SQL
- Cloud Scheduler to schedule the backup
- Application Load Balancers to handle traffic
- Artifact registry to pull ghcr.io images
- Buckets to handle webfinger

## Prerequisites

- GCP billing account
- Cloudflare zone and token
- Backblaze bucket and application key

## Private key

This module doesn't rely on the autogenerated keys that `pocket-id` creates.
Instead it uploads the private key to a GCP secret.
Create one yourself, with the `alg`/`size` of your choosing.
Since it's set via a write-only argument, it can be deleted
afterward:

```
step-cli crypto jwk create \
  /dev/null jwt_private_key.json \
  --kty=RSA \
  --alg=RS256 \
  --use=sig \
  --size=2048 \
  --force \
  --no-password --insecure
```

## TODO

- Optionally restore from Backblaze
